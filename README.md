# phpPgAdmin

PHP Based administration tool for PostgreSQL. 
phppgadmin with funky support for Postgresql 10 and PHP 7. 

This is a hard fork of [phppgadmin](https://github.com/phppgadmin/phppgadmin) which aims to add the following enhancements:


- PHP 7+ support (Tested on PHP 7.1.10)
- Support for PostgreSQL 10. It also runs with PostgreSQL 9.4, PostgreSQL 9.5, PostgreSQL 9.6, PostgreSQL 9.7, PostgreSQL 9.8, PostgreSQL 9.9, PostgreSQL 10, PostgreSQL 11, PostgreSQL 12 (Future versions). This is not full support, but funky one where you don't really need all the new features of the new PostgreSQL version. It technically works as 9.4 for any version above it. 


## Installation

Downloand as phppgadmin and change config file in conf folder. Rename config.inc.php to config.inc.php and add your config options. 


Enjoy:)
